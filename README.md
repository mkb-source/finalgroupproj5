# finalgroupproj5
Our Final Group Project for BAS 475. This project was made with three other people, and is
a comprehensive overview of stock data. This project contains widgets that allow the user to 
view stock data based on the symbol with a sidebar panel, select data with a date range input box, 
and returns a time series plot, a plot with pure stock data, and the information for a selected
stock.
